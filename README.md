- üìú **Location History**: View your past locations with timestamps
- üö´ **Offline Support**: Fallback display for when map services are unavailable

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Maps**: Leaflet with OpenStreetMap
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd live-location-tracking
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
PORT=7890
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/location-tracker
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

4. **Start MongoDB**

Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:

```bash
mongod
```

5. **Start the application**

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running at http://localhost:7890

## Usage

1. **Register a new account** at http://localhost:7890/register.html
2. **Log in** with your credentials at http://localhost:7890/login.html
3. **Enable location permissions** when prompted by your browser
4. **Track your location** by clicking the "Start Tracking" button
5. **View your location history** at the bottom of the dashboard

## Debugging

If you encounter issues, use the built-in debug tool:

1. Open http://localhost:7890/debug.html
2. Check the server status and API connections
3. Test registration and login functionality
4. View detailed error messages and environment information

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"

This error occurs when the API is returning HTML instead of JSON. Possible causes:

- The API endpoint doesn't exist
- The server isn't running
- There's a network or CORS issue

**Solution**: 
- Use the debug tool to test the API endpoints
- Check the server console for errors
- Ensure the correct API base URL is being used

#### 2. Maps Not Loading

If the map doesn't load but your location coordinates appear:

- Check your internet connection
- Verify that OpenStreetMap isn't blocked on your network
- Look for console errors related to Leaflet

#### 3. Location Not Updating

If your location isn't being tracked:

- Ensure you've granted location permissions in your browser
- Check that the "Start Tracking" button has been clicked
- Verify your device has GPS capabilities

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/login` - Login with email and password

### Location

- `POST /api/location` - Save current location (requires authentication)
- `GET /api/locations` - Get location history (requires authentication)

### System

- `GET /api/health` - Check if server is running
